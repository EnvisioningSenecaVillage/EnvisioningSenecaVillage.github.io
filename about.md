## the Project

*Envisioning Seneca Village* wrestles with one stark fact: Despite its significance, *no photos or drawings of Seneca Village survive*.

That said, Seneca Village—as one of many historical and contemporary communities that has suffered disruption and displacement—is relatively well studied. This project aims to build upon existing (and ongoing) research and scholarship on the village and its history to create an accessible, grounded, and experiential image of an important place in New York City’s history. In several ways, the project’s goal is to bring the thoughtful work of many researchers to new audiences, within New York and beyond, to enhance public knowledge and memory about this community.

The process of building the 3D model integrated diverse source material, earlier findings, and different methods from various fields. Still, the project also required speculation and making informed assumptions to imagine how Seneca Village might have appeared just before its destruction in 1857. Throughout the process, we have sought a balance between depicting what is known today and representing what life within this community may have been. (For more information about how the model was developed, including considerations and assumptions, see [Methodology](/methodology). For a complete list of our sources, see [References](/references).)

In addition to the 3D model, we have included a static (non-interactive and printable) [Tour through Seneca Village](/tour). Forthcoming are teaching guides to illustrate how the model can be used in high school courses.

## the Team

The project is a collaboration between **Gergely Baics**, **Meredith Linn**, **Leah Meisterlin**, and **Myles Zhang**. Our team also included research assistants: Barnard College students **Sarah Baybeck**, **Maia Donald**, and **Jesse Pearce**. Additional support has been provided by the Central Park Conservancy and generous guidance from advisors listed [below](#project-advisors).

**Gergely Baics** ([gbaics@barnard.edu](mailto:gbaics@barnard.edu); [faculty profile](https://barnard.edu/profiles/gergely-baics)) is Associate Professor of History and Urban Studies at Barnard College, Columbia University. His research areas include urban history (Americas & Europe), spatial history, U.S. economic and social history, and social science history methods. He is the author of *Feeding Gotham: The Political Economy and Geography of Food in New York, 1790-1860* (Princeton University Press, 2016). His articles have appeared in the *Journal of Urban History*, *Urban History*, the *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*, and *Planning Perspectives*. He is also one of the Co-PIs on the public spatial history project [*Mapping Historical New York: A Digital Atlas*](https://mappinghny.com).

**Meredith Linn** ([meredith.linn@bgc.bard.edu](mailto:meredith.linn@bgc.bard.edu); [faculty profile](https://www.bgc.bard.edu/people/170/meredith-b-linn)) is an assistant professor at Bard Graduate Center and a historical archaeologist. She researches artifacts, documents, and oral histories to discover more about people omitted from traditional histories. She is particularly interested in issues of health, healing, and community in 19th-century New York City. Her book, *Irish Fever: An Archaeology of Illness, Injury, and Healing in New York City, 1845–1875*, investigates the experiences of Irish immigrants, and she is an assistant director of a long-term collaborative team researching the predominately African American community of Seneca Village.

**Leah Meisterlin** ([leah@leahmeisterlin.com](mailto:leah@leahmeisterlin.com); [website](https://www.leahmeisterlin.com)) is an urbanist, cartographer, and geospatial methodologist. Broadly, her work engages techniques of social representation in data visualization, critical geospatial analytics, and informational ethics. Her articles and essays have appeared in the *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*, *Planning Perspectives*, the *Avery Review*, and *Human Geography*. Among others, her work has been shown in exhibition at the Oslo Architecture Triennial and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She is also one of the Co-PIs on the public spatial history project [*Mapping Historical New York: A Digital Atlas*](https://mappinghny.com).

**Myles Zhang** ([mylesz@umich.edu](mailto:mylesz@umich.edu); [website](https://www.myleszhang.org/)) is a PhD candidate in architecture and urban history at the University of Michigan. His dissertation examines how state policy drove urban decline in Detroit and Detroit-like spaces, in which state actors and market influences target specific urban neighborhoods and communities and subject them to displacement. Using the tools of history and archives, this work challenges the popular misconception that particular urban neighborhoods are marginalized as a result of the work ethic of those who occupy and live there.
