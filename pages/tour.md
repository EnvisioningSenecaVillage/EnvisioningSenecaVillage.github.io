A non-interactive version of the tour through the Seneca Village model is presented below, with its annotations.

## 1. Visualizing a Village
This model envisions how Seneca Village might have appeared just before its destruction in 1857. No photos or drawings survive, so our team integrated decades of historical and archaeological research with new digital mapping methods. (1) We used old maps and geographic information systems (GIS) to make an accurate map of lost roads, cemeteries, buildings, historic elevation, farmland, rock outcrops, and trees. (2) We modeled buildings with 3D software, basing their size and appearance on archival sources, archaeological finds, and informed assumptions about 19th-century architecture. (3) We added visual details and notes about villagers, drawing on [social historical](https://bit.ly/49a) and [archaeological research](https://bit.ly/42ll) into documents (census, tax, church, etc.) and material evidence from excavation.

## 2. Nanny Goat Hill
The highest point of natural elevation in Central Park is a giant outcrop of schist bedrock, 142 ft above sea level, today called Summit Rock. Seneca Villagers reportedly called it Nanny Goat Hill, likely reflecting how they used it to graze animals. From it, visitors today can still see the many bedrock outcrops that distinguish the landscape and made large-scale farming and construction difficult in the past, partially explaining the area’s slow real estate development. The hill offered views of the rolling terrain of the nearby village of [Bloomingdale, the Hudson River, and the Palisades of New Jersey to the west](https://bit.ly/4dIl4VT) and the imposing Croton Receiving Reservoir and Yorkville to the east. To the south, the urban core of the city grew closer, reaching approximately 14th Street when Seneca Village began in 1825 and 42nd Street when the city destroyed the village in 1857. For more than 30 years, the hill sheltered a thriving community founded by African Americans.

## 3. Origins of Seneca Village
In 1825, just before emancipation in NY state, a few African American men and women and the AME Zion Church purchased land from John and Elizabeth Whitehead, a white couple. Others followed. By 1857 about 50 families lived here—about ⅔ were Black and ⅓ white, most from Ireland. There were also three churches and a school. The village offered a safer environment than downtown, where epidemics and hostility to Black integration were rife. Property enabled Black men to vote (a requirement not applied to white men) and offered some economic freedom. Families provisioned themselves and supplemented wages by raising crops and animals. Some rented plots for income or to help relatives. Some journalists sought to diminish the place out of prejudice or to justify its destruction to build Central Park, but the village was not the poor shantytown they described. It was a flourishing, heterogeneous, and complex community. These notes highlight just a few of the village’s features and families.

## 4. All Angels' Episcopal Church & Cemetery

The village’s three churches and a school were located at its center. All Angels’ Episcopal Church was a racially integrated “mission” church of the wealthy white [St. Michael's Church in Bloomingdale](https://bit.ly/4bMrgul), whose clergy created a Sunday school in the village in 1833. By 1847, Rev. Thomas McClure Peters held church services in the home of white villagers William and Frances Evers. The church was built in 1849 for $2000 on property four Ludlow family sisters deeded for $1 to “always be used…solely for a site of a Protestant Episcopal Church…and for a place for the burial of deceased members of the Church.” In 1857, the church was moved and reassembled at 81st St. and 11th Ave. [Photos from 1887](https://bit.ly/4dKtZGg) and an 1850 Christian Witness and Church Advocate article inform our model that includes a fence, “quatrefoil window, peaked gable, and turret enclosing a small bell.” The cemetery was the final resting place of many villagers.

## 5. All Angels' Episcopal Church Interior

According to the [*Christian Witness and Church Advocate*](https://bit.ly/4dCS2XA), inside, there were three windows on each side of the nave and a triplet 7-by-9 ft. east window. The woodwork was pine painted to look like costlier black walnut. The 1855 census estimated that the building could seat two hundred people, but about thirty attended regularly. This church was cardinally aligned, with the altar facing east, unlike all other buildings in the village oriented to the city grid. [All Angels’ Church](https://bit.ly/3wr3vJc) is the only village church with surviving parish records noting baptisms, marriages, and burials. These records provide us with invaluable information about relationships between villagers; a [page from 1850](https://bit.ly/3wCdwTZ) includes burials and baptisms of members of the interrelated Morris, Riddles, and Wilson families.
