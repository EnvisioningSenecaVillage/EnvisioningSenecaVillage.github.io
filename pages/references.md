Samuel Stillwell was an important lay leader and trustee of the John St. Methodist Church, a surveyor, and a close friend of governor DeWitt Clinton (Bradley 1856, 72, 75). William M. Stillwell administered sacraments to AME Zion before the congregation could ordain their own minister; he also led a schism of white parishioners from the John St. Methodist Church, who objected to the clergy attempting to take power from the lay members (Bradley 1856 62, 72–76, 81–83). In 1822, along with two other white Methodist ministers, William Stillwell ordained Abraham Thompson, James Varick, and Leven Smith as Elders [ministers] (Bradley 1956, 95).  
**Samuel Stillwell’s property**: Randel 1820, Map No. 41; Sage 1856.

### 12. AME Zion Church

In 1828, Leven Smith was urged for the position of Superintendent [Bishop] but he declined (Bradley 1956, 101).  
**Women in the AME Zion church**: Women were included in voting and had supported the church from its beginnings with donations and in abolitionist causes. Some prominent female abolitionists and suffragists, including Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth, were members (Bradley 1956, 56, 79–82, 108). See also Hood 1895, 159–161.  
**Church building in Seneca Village**: New-York Daily Tribune 1853, 7. Details of our rendering, such as the cupola and  building entrance were inspired by other AME Zion churches, especially [St. David AME Zion Church](https://maap.columbia.edu/mbl_place/59.html), built in 1840 in the Eastville community of Sag Harbor, NY (MAAP 2024), and [Salem AME Zion Church](https://www.roslynlandmarks.org/profiles/salem-ame-church), built in 1862 in Roslyn, NY (Roslyn Landmark Society 2025).

Levin Smith portrait: The only known image of a Seneca Village resident is an artist’s portrait of Smith in the collection of Mother AME Zion Church, reproduced in New-York Historical Society Education Department 2010, 17.

Andrew Williams also purchased a home in Yorkville.

**Growing concerns about hygiene**: Brown 2009.

Note that while human waste was thought to be potentially dangerous to health because of the foul vapors, or “miasmas,” they emitted, the idea that microscopic organisms, or “germs,” within fecal matter caused disease would not be discovered until the 1870s and not widely accepted for at least a decade after that.

### 19. Geary House

**Property location and purchase date**: NYPTAR 1849; Sage 1856. Miller (2022, 283–284) notes that the wealthy NYC cotton merchant George G. Root commissioned a large “house, stables, sheds, icehouse, & c.” on the property (per an 1846 advertisement) in order to create a resort by the reservoir, but he declared bankruptcy and the property changed hands a few times before being purchased by the City for the use of the reservoir keeper. This explains the large size of the house and why it had a piazza or covered porch.  
**Piazza**: Common Council of the City of New York 1853?.

**Roman Catholicism**: Several of the Geary children were baptized in the Roman Catholic Church in St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral and St. Peter’s, Archdiocese of New York 1831.
