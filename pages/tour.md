A non-interactive version of the tour through the Seneca Village model is presented below, with its annotations. See [References](/references) for notes and citations for each entry.

## 1. Visualizing a Village

![Aerial view of the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/01_VisualizingAVillage.png)

The model envisions how Seneca Village might have appeared just before its destruction in 1857. No photos or drawings survive, so our team integrated decades of historical and archaeological research with new digital mapping methods. (1) We used old maps and geographic information systems (GIS) to make an accurate map of lost roads, cemeteries, buildings, historic elevation, farmland, rock outcrops, and trees. (2) We modeled buildings with 3D software, basing their size and appearance on archival sources, archaeological finds, and informed assumptions about 19th-century architecture. (3) We added visual details and notes about villagers, drawing on [social historical](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801497513/the-park-and-the-people/#bookTabs=1) and [archaeological research](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/map/seneca-village/project/seneca-village-project-2018) into documents (census, tax, church, etc.) and material evidence from excavation.

## 2. Nanny Goat Hill

![Bird’s-eye view of Nanny Goat Hill (Summit Rock) and the surrounding area within the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/02_NannyGoatHill.png)

The highest point of natural elevation in Central Park is a giant outcrop of schist bedrock, 142 ft above sea level, today called Summit Rock. Seneca Villagers reportedly called it Nanny Goat Hill, likely reflecting how they used it to graze animals. From it, visitors today can still see the many bedrock outcrops that distinguish the landscape and made large-scale farming and construction difficult in the past, partially explaining the area’s slow real estate development. The hill offered views of the rolling terrain of the nearby village of [Bloomingdale, the Hudson River, and the Palisades of New Jersey to the west](/annotation_assets/View-from-Seneca-Village-to-Hudson-River.jpg) and the imposing Croton Receiving Reservoir and Yorkville to the east. To the south, the urban core of the city grew closer, reaching approximately 14th Street when Seneca Village began in 1825 and 42nd Street when the city destroyed the village in 1857. For more than 30 years, the hill sheltered a thriving community founded by African Americans.

## 3. Origins of Seneca Village

![North-facing view looking toward All Angels’ Episcopal Church in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/03_OriginsOfSenecaVillage.png)

In 1825, just before emancipation in NY state, a few African American men and women and the AME Zion Church purchased land from John and Elizabeth Whitehead, a white couple. Others followed. By 1857 about 50 families lived here—about ⅔ were Black and ⅓ white, most from Ireland. There were also three churches and a school. The village offered a safer environment than downtown, where epidemics and hostility to Black integration were rife. Property enabled Black men to vote (a requirement not applied to white men) and offered some economic freedom. Families provisioned themselves and supplemented wages by raising crops and animals. Some rented plots for income or to help relatives. Some journalists sought to diminish the place out of prejudice or to justify its destruction to build Central Park, but the village was not the poor shantytown they described. It was a flourishing, heterogeneous, and complex community. These notes highlight just a few of the village’s features and families.

## 4. All Angels' Episcopal Church and Cemetery

![View of All Angels’ Episcopal Church showing its entrance at its western facade within the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/04_AllAngelsEpiscopalChurch_Cemetery.png)

The village’s three churches and a school were located at its center. All Angels’ Episcopal Church was a racially integrated “mission” church of the wealthy white [St. Michael's Church in Bloomingdale](/annotation_assets/St.-Michael's-Bloomingdale-cemetery-and-church-built-1807.jpg.jpeg), whose clergy created a Sunday school in the village in 1833. By 1847, Rev. Thomas McClure Peters held church services in the home of white villagers William and Frances Evers. The church was built in 1849 for $2000 on property four Ludlow family sisters deeded for $1 to “always be used…solely for a site of a Protestant Episcopal Church…and for a place for the burial of deceased members of the Church.” In 1857, the church was moved and reassembled at 81st St. and 11th Ave. [Photos from 1887](/annotation_assets/All-Angels'-Church-in-1887.jpg.jpeg) and an 1850 *Christian Witness and Church Advocate* article inform our model that includes a fence, “quatrefoil window, peaked gable, and turret enclosing a small bell.” The cemetery was the final resting place of many villagers.

## 5. All Angels' Episcopal Church Interior

![Interior view of All Angels’ Episcopal Church within the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/05_AllAngelsEpiscopalChurch_Interior.png)

According to the [*Christian Witness and Church Advocate*](/annotation_assets/Christian-Witness-&-Church-Advocate-on-January-4-1850.pdf), inside, there were three windows on each side of the nave and a triplet 7-by-9 ft. east window. The woodwork was pine painted to look like costlier black walnut. The interior of the church probably looked a lot like the [photo of the interior in 1887](/annotation_assets/Annotation-Thumbnail-All-Angels-Interior-View.jpg). The 1855 census estimated that the building could seat two hundred people, but about thirty attended regularly. This church was cardinally aligned, with the altar facing east, unlike all other buildings in the village oriented to the city grid. [All Angels’ Church](https://allangelschurch.com/our-history/) is the only village church with surviving parish records noting baptisms, marriages, and burials. These records provide us with invaluable information about relationships between villagers; a [page from 1850](/annotation_assets/All-Angels'-Sample-of-Records-in-1850.pdf) includes burials and baptisms of members of the interrelated Morris, Riddles, and Wilson families.

## 6. Wilson Family House

![View of the northwestern corner of the Wilson Family House, from the All Angels’ Church cemetery, within the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/06_WilsonFamilyHouse.png)

Next to All Angels’ Church was the Wilson family’s home. Built ca.1849, the three-story, wood-frame structure sat on a foundation of [local schist stones and mortar](/annotation_assets/Wilson%20House%20foundation%20corner.jpg.JPG) and had [a red-brick chimney](/annotation_assets/Wilson%20House%20brick%20chimney%20with%20mortar%20and%20plaster.jpg.JPG) and a [tin-coated iron roof](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/seneca-village-210721-metal-roofing-tile). William Godfrey Wilson, 41 in 1855, was a porter and sexton (caretaker) of All Angels’. His wife, Charlotte Morris Wilson, 39, likely grew up in the village. Her mother, Nancy Morris, had owned land there since 1829, and her sister, Angelina Morris Riddles, later was also a village landowner. By 1857, the Wilsons had 9 children, between 19 years and a few months old, all living in the house. In 2011, a [team of archaeologists and students excavated](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/map/seneca-village/project/seneca-village-project-2018) part of the remains of their home.

## 7. Wilson Family House Artifacts

![View of the front of the Wilson Family House from the road in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/07_WilsonFamilyHouseArtifacts.png)

Archaeological excavations unearthed possessions the Wilsons left behind when they were forced to leave their home that are clues about things they did, what they liked, what they could afford, and how they presented themselves. Artifacts include blue printed [English dishes](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/search/keyword:all-angels-printed--site:seneca-village), a [Chinese porcelain platter](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/seneca-village-210504-underglaze-painted-chinese-porcelain-platter), [flower pots](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/seneca-village-210495-redware-flower-pot), a bone [toothbrush](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/seneca-village-210712-bone-toothbrush-handle), a wool and leather [shoe](/annotation_assets/Wilson-House-shoe.jpg), and a [blue-beaded necklace](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/seneca-village-210697-faceted-glass-beads). These items express genteel taste and concern for hygiene and self-presentation. [Stoneware jars](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/search/keyword:all-angels-stoneware--site:seneca-village), for preserving vegetables and meats, and a lead [fishing weight](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/seneca-village-210719-lead-weight), likely used to catch dinner in the nearby Hudson River, indicate self-provisioning. [Slate pencils](https://archaeology.cityofnewyork.us/collection/search/seneca-village-210691-slate-pencil) and censuses show the family’s commitment to educating their children; census records indicate Mrs. Wilson learned to read and write alongside them.

## 8. African Union Church

![View of the African Union Church from its cemetery in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/08_AfricanUnionChurch.png)

African Union Church was the first church built in the village and one of two Black Methodist churches. Constructed around 1840 on land purchased in 1837, it was the satellite church of a larger one built on 15th St and 6th Ave in 1836. An article in the [*Colored American*](/annotation_assets/Colored%20American%20on%20March%2028%201840.pdf) described the New York congregation as “a plain and exemplary people” and the Seneca Village church as “a small frame building.” The denomination was founded in Delaware, where one of the church’s preachers living in Seneca Village, William Mathew, also originated. By 1855, the state census described the building’s condition as “poor” and noted its capacity to seat 100 worshippers, though 50 usually attended. The church also had a cemetery. NYC death records at the Municipal Archives contain some information about individuals buried there.

## 9. Colored School #3

![Rear view of the school building (right) attached to the African Union Church (left) with an outdoor play area for children (foreground) in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/09_ColoredSchool3.png)

Attached to African Union Church was Colored School #3, part of the city’s segregated public school system. Teacher Caroline W. Simpson instructed children as young as 6 in primary subjects and likely older students in grammar, composition, history, geography, math, and astronomy (important for boys who would be sailors). The school probably hosted night classes in literacy for adults. [African Free Schools](/annotation_assets/African-Free-School.jpg), the precursor to NYC public schools, were first created by white elites of the New York Manumission Society in 1787. Many alumni became community leaders and advocated for abolition, equality, and education. Even so, inequality prevented many children in the city from going to school, because many families needed income from their children to survive. Evidence from documents and archaeology suggest conditions were better for children in Seneca Village and almost every child of school age (between the approximate ages of 4 and 14)  attended school.

## 10. School Yard & Games

![View of the outdoor play area for children, featuring hopscotch and toys, in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/10_SchoolYardAndGames.png)

About 60 children between age 4 and 14 lived in Seneca Village in 1855. Most attended school and helped their parents with a variety of chores—such as tending animals, gardens, and younger siblings, hauling water, running errands, sweeping yards, and other housework—but they also played. Compared to dense neighborhoods downtown where children entertained themselves on crowded streets, cramped backyards, or along the waterfront, Seneca Village offered children ample outdoor space, including rock outcrops and trees to climb, a varied topography to run around and play catch or hide and seek, and the school yard to play games during breaks. We interpreted the school yard as a play area showing typical 19th-century games, including two hopscotch courts with period-era layouts, three canvas balls, a wooden hoop which could be rolled on the ground or around the waist like a hula hoop, as well as toys such as dolls made from a corn husk, wooden spoon, and handkerchief, and a drum.

## 11. AME Zion Church & Greenhouse

![View of the AME Zion Church building (foreground), its cemetery, and a greenhouse in the background from the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/11_AMEZionChurchAndGreenhouse.png)

The [African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church](https://amez.org/our-church/) and its members were the first village landowners. AME Zion broke from the John Street Methodist Church in 1796 and was the city’s first Black church, dubbed the “Freedom Church” for its abolitionist work. In 1825, the church purchased land in Seneca Village for burial grounds—ground penetrating radar tests confirm burials remain today—but did not construct a building until 1853. This late date is strong evidence that residents did not anticipate the village’s coming destruction. A [*New-York Daily Tribune*](/annotation_assets/1853-news-article-about-laying-the-corner-stone-of-AME-Zion-Church.jpg) article on laying the church’s cornerstone reported 100 congregants and described the future church building as wooden, painted white, with a basement school room for the education of Black children. The 1856 Sage map, assessing properties the city would take for the park, shows a greenhouse on AME Zion’s property, possibly owned and used by the neighboring Hampton family.

## 12. Haff House & Garden 

![View of the Haff House and large garden from the neighboring AME Zion Church in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/12_HaffHouseAndGarden.png)

This large property once belonged to [Levin Smith](/annotation_assets/Levin-Smith-drawing.jpg), a deacon and trustee of AME Zion, who built this house ca. 1829. From 1842 to 1857, it was the home of the Haffs, the only known US-born white family in the village in 1855. Mrs. Haff, born Ann Eliza Stillwell, was daughter of Rev. William M. Stillwell of the John St. Methodist Church, who ministered to the church’s Black members after they formed AME Zion. Rev. Stillwell acquired the property after Smith defaulted on a mortgage and availed it to his son-in-law, John P. Haff. Haff was a successful gardener, awarded for his turnips at the American Institute of the City of New York's 1843 fair. He was also an innkeeper at Elm Park, an inn and horse racing and picnic ground at 9th Ave and 91st St. With links to AME Zion, Haff likely exchanged agricultural knowledge with neighbors, who had their own gardens and expertise. The 1855 census valued the frame home at $1500 and noted the Haffs’ five children, ages 3 to 17.

## 13. Williams House

![Rear view of the Williams House, from the Haff Garden, in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/13_WilliamsHouse.png)

Andrew Williams was the first person to buy land in Seneca Village in 1825, then a young NJ-born bootblack. In 1855, he was about 60 and a cartman. He and his wife, Elizabeth, 45, shared their home with son Jeremiah, 19, a waiter; his wife Ann, 28; and grandson Andrew Elias, 8, son of daughter Ellen. The Williamses were AME Zion members. Mr. Williams was also a member of the [African Society for Mutual Relief](https://maap.columbia.edu/place/25.html). His property included two adjacent lots and a structure labeled “shanty” on the 1856 Sage map. The Williamses’  daughter Ellen, 28, and her husband John F. Butler, 29, a laborer, lived there just beyond the trees—one of several cases where people listed as renters in the census were family members of village landowners. Mr. Williams objected in [a formal letter](/annotation_assets/Andrew-Williams,-Letter-of-Affidavit.jpg.jpeg) to the small sum the city offered to compensate him for seizing his property. The only known descendants of Seneca Villagers are members of the [Williams family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxVLdQgGgs).

## 14. Landin House & Stable

![Front view of the Landin House and Stable from the road in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/14_LandinHouseAndStable.png)

Next to the Williamses lived the Landins, whose three-story house was built in the 1830s. It included a two-story portion apparently rented to the Jackson family from Westchester Co. and an attached stable, one of only five in the village. Josiah Landin, 50 in 1855, was born in Georgia, while his wife Dinah (or Diana, records vary), 40, was born in New York. They had a large family, with at least six children of their own, many baptized at All Angels’ Church. [In 1855, their household](/annotation_assets/Landin-Family-on-1855-Census.pdf.jpg) included three of their own children, 18, 16, and 11, and two adopted grandchildren, infant sons of daughter Sarah, who had married John Peterson in 1852. An ambitious purchaser of land (owning $5000-worth in 1850), Mr. Landin became overextended and lost this property in a financial downturn, but rented it from the new landowner, white NJ merchant Andrew C. Zabriskie, whom he seems to have known. Landin was resourceful and also had a business planting ornamental shrubs.

## 15. 86th Street

![East-facing view of 86th street, with the Williams, Landin, and McCollin Houses in near view and the reservoir in the distance, from the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/15_86thStreet.png)

The Williams, Landin, and McCollin houses fronted 86th Street, the busiest in the village. According to the 1855 Viele map, which assessed the topography and built environment of lands taken for Central Park, it was the only street wide enough for horse-drawn vehicles to cross Manhattan between 59th and 106th Streets. Running along the Croton Reservoir’s northern side, 86th Street connected Yorkville on the East side with Bloomingdale on the West side. Contemporaries often referred to Seneca Village as Yorkville, reflecting its status as the most significant settlement north of 42nd Street. Seneca Villagers had ties to Yorkville–some had personal relations and others may have worked there as laborers or domestics. After Seneca Village’s destruction, a few families moved there. We depict 86th Street with horse-drawn traffic to show how this street connected the village to other nearby villages and resources. Today, the 86th Transverse Road is one of three arteries crossing Central Park.

## 16. McCollin Houses

![Front view of the McCollin Houses from the road in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/16_McCollinHouses.png)

This 1830s home was one of the village’s three highest-valued in 1855 at $4000, owned by Westchester-born cook Obidiah McCollin, then 63. The high value was likely due to its better materials and looks, as it was no larger than other homes valued less. Next door was a house owned by his wife, Elizabeth Harding McCollin, 50, one of the first landowners in the village, who rented out this and at least one other property. They [married](/annotation_assets/McCollin-Marriage-United-Method-Church-Records.jpg) in 1826 in the Methodist Church and were likely AME Zion members. Behind these houses were their outhouses and planted fields merging into land once belonging to Elizabeth's mother, Diana Harding. Her father, Samuel Harding, 94, may have been born enslaved on Staten Island. He lived with them in 1855, along with Frederick Riddles, 6, son of Charlotte Wilson’s sister. The McCollins brought real estate savvy and food management skills to the village and were among several families who took relatives and friends into their home.

## 17. McCollin Outhouses

![Tree-top view of McCollin outhouses in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/17_McCollinOuthouses.png)

Two structures on the McCollins’ properties are not labeled on the 1856 Sage map, but their size and location suggest they are outhouses, small wooden structures with one or more seats over a pit serving as a toilet. Village houses, like many in the city then, did not have indoor plumbing, and the city’s patchy sewer system had not yet reached the area. Outhouses, or privies, were used by all social classes, as were chamber pots, vessels used indoors and emptied into privies. Growing concerns about hygiene and privacy, especially among the middle class, led people to place outhouses on property edges as far as possible from their homes. “Night-soil men” were paid to excavate privy shafts when full and cart away waste, which they dumped in the rivers or sold for fertilizer. Human and animal waste were valuable for enriching agricultural soils, and likely used in that way by Seneca Villagers. The McCollins’ privies are among the few shown on the map and were thus likely more substantial than most.

## 18. Geary House

![Side and rear view of Geary House with the reservoir in the distance from the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/18_GearyHouse.png)

This home on a large property purchased in 1849 by the Corporation of the City of New York was dignified by a “piazza,” or covered porch. It was for use by the Croton Reservoir keeper, John Geary, 62 in 1855. Geary immigrated from Cork, Ireland, as a child and married NY-born Catherine McGlade in 1826. They had 14 children, per their family Bible, and were Roman Catholic. In 1855, their household was the largest in the village: 10 of their children, between 25 and 2 years old; a cousin, 46, working as a domestic; two step-grandchildren, 8 and 7; and a neighbor’s child, 8. Two of their older daughters were teachers, another a dressmaker, and a son a stonecutter. On the property south of the house were a shed, barn, and stable for domestic animals. To what extent the family was integrated into the village community is hard to know. The reservoir’s imposing structure was a visible footprint of the city, and the Gearys lived in the village because of John’s position as a city employee.

## 19. Croton Receiving Reservoir

![Aerial view of the Croton Receiving Reservoir from the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/19_CrotonReceivingReservoir.png)

Opened in 1842, the Croton water system that brought clean water from upstate was an engineering marvel, and by far the city’s costliest and largest public works, consisting of above and below-ground aqueducts, a Receiving Reservoir near Seneca Village, and one for distributing at today's Bryant Park. Visitors traveled by omnibus or private carriage to walk atop the fortress-like stone wall of the Receiving Reservoir. Seneca Village was in their view, but a [contemporary sketch](/annotation_assets/Croton-Receiving-Reservoir-in-1842.jpg) tellingly omits it. The reservoir impacted the village, however. It was a major construction site for years. Some villagers, many laborers, may have helped build it. The Croton system’s excellent water was never piped to their homes, but they may have obtained it informally because the embankment was close to street grade at 86th Street. If so, they had a valuable resource, for Croton water was rarely available to working-class New Yorkers in downtown tenements or modest uptown homes until decades later.

## 20. 85th Street

![Cutaway view of 85th Street showing the underground aqueduct in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/20_85thStreet.png)

The Receiving Reservoir was supplied with fresh water by the gravity-fed Croton Aqueduct, a 38-mile long brick masonry tunnel, with dimensions of circa 8 feet wide by 8 feet high—allowing aqueduct keepers to walk inside and inspect the structure.The aqueduct ran under or close to ground from the Old Croton Dam in Westchester County to the reservoir’s influent gate at 85th Street. 85th Street was also the main public street of Seneca Village, with all three churches, the school house, and several homes, including the Wilsons’, Gearys’, and Hamptons’ fronting it. To construct the aqueduct, which ran 5 to 10 feet beneath 85th Street, the street had to be excavated and then covered with a new surface sometime before 1842. To reflect this, we have depicted 85th Street with a better maintained quality and texture of dirt, and indicated the aqueduct underneath in dotted lines.

## 21. Mathew House

![Front view of the Mathew house from across the road in the 3D model of Seneca Village](/annotation_assets/21_MathewHouse.png)

Owned by William M. Mathew, this home was one of the three highest-valued in the village: $4000 in 1855. Mathew, 43, a whitewasher and African Union Church preacher, and his wife Ann, 30, were from Delaware. They shared their house with another Black family from Maryland, the Snowdens: Darius, 39, a waiter; wife Matilda, 28; and their two daughters, 11 and 9. Like Andrew Williams, [Mathew petitioned](/annotation_assets/William%20Mathews%20Petition%20(Meredith%20Linn%20Transcription).pdf) the city for more compensation than the $1235 offered for taking his home of 23 years to build the park. He detailed improvements he had made “with a view to a permanent home”: he rebuilt the original (ca.1832) house in 1845, costing between $400 and $500; installed a well, $50; planted shrubs and fruit trees, $100; and raised the property to street grade, $50. Agricultural fields and fruit trees on the south side of the property and willow-like trees on the east side may have provided privacy from the Croton Reservoir. A stream also ran just east of the property.
