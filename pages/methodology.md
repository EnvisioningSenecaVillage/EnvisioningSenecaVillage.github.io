The model imagines how Seneca Village might have appeared just before its destruction in 1857. No photos or drawings of the Village survive. Our team integrated decades of historical and archaeological research with digital mapping methods, combining cartographic and social history with geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D modeling software. A [visual summary](#visual-summary) of the workflow is included at the end of this page.

# Digitizing and Combining Cartographic Sources
Our team used historical maps and geographic information systems (GIS) to create an accurate digital map of lost roads, cemeteries, and buildings as well as historical topography, farmland, rock outcrops, and trees. Our cartographic sources are included in the [References Cited](/pages/references.md) list.

For example, two of our main sources of cartographic information were the 1855 Viele Map and the 1856 Sage Map. The Viele Map includes information about roads and paths, locations and sizes of trees, and streams. It also outlines the areas of planted and cultivated fields and provides topographic elevation measurements. The Sage Map was originally created to detail property information as the land for Central Park was condemned through eminent domain, and thus it contains more information about specific buildings and their owners. Buildings within the Sage Map are described with detailed footprints, the number of stories, and their use distinguishing houses, churches, sheds, and stables.

Scanned maps were georeferenced (given digital coordinates that correspond to physical locations). The individual features of these georeferenced maps were digitally traced. In this process, building footprints are outlined, tree locations are recorded, roads are drawn, and all other physical information is translated into a digital map. 

# Spatializing and Visualizing the Digital Map in 3D
We visualized the 2-dimensional digital map in 3D, adding materials and other details, with 3D modeling software. Much of the basic information needed for the model was found in the historical map sources. For example, building sizes and heights (number of stories) are listed in the Sage Map. Other decisions involved combining information from archival sources and archaeological finds. These sources are included in our [References Cited](/pages/references.md) list.

Still, modeling the Village required speculation and making informed assumptions. These assumptions were supported by a variety of factors including New York’s 19th-century architectural history, the variation in declared value of different properties, and input from many of the researchers and scholars who have studied Seneca Village. A detailed list of these assumptions can be found in our [Speculations and Assumptions](/pages/speculations.md) list.

With all of this in mind, the model is more certain near the ground than at its rooftops. As a result, we have attempted to indicate the variation between historical and archaeological records and informed speculation. The model’s rendering is more opaque where greater levels of research confirms our choices and more transparent where an educated imagination must fill in the gaps.

# Adding the Social Dimension
Of course, Seneca Village was not an empty place before its destruction. Instead, it was a community of families with people of all ages, several professions, and different backgrounds. We added visual details and notes on the villagers, drawing on social historical and archaeological research. These included census, church, and tax records as well as material evidence from excavation. The social dimension of life within Seneca Village is described in the model’s annotations as well as its visualization.

For example, census records include the individuals living in each home and their occupations. Several of these professions require specific tools or equipment that would have been present. Similarly, the number of children across the Village contributes to the model in the form of games and toys. (And, as families today still know, particularly large families require more laundry.)

The model also aims to indicate how everyday life would have influenced the appearance of the Village. Spaces of congregation, such as churches and schools, or higher levels of foot traffic are reflected on the ground. Wells indicate the common and necessary activity of gathering water at its sources. And animals, along with the fencing they require, speak to both sustenance activities and work.
