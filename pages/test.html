    <i>Envisioning Seneca Village</i> provides an interactive 3D model of how Seneca Village might have looked just before the community’s destruction in 1857 to build Central Park. 
    For a (printable) non-interactive tour through the model with its annotations, see <a href="https://envisioningsenecavillage.github.io/tour/">Tour through Seneca Village</a>.

<p>
    Dating to 1825, two years before emancipation was completed in New York State, Seneca Village by the mid-nineteenth century had become a community of about 50 families–about ⅔ Black and ⅓ white, mostly Irish. 
    Situated at the city’s outskirts on a four-block area east of present-day Central Park West between 82nd and 86th Streets, it offered Africans Americans a safer, freer environment to live than downtown. 
    Villagers built a thriving, complex, and heterogeneous community with core institutions including three churches and a school. 
    Seneca Village’s destruction by the City in 1857 abruptly ended 30 years of effort to nurture families, sustain livelihoods, and create community. 
    It was also the first instance in a long history of the City’s abuse of eminent domain to sacrifice Black neighborhoods for urban development projects–in this case, to build a world-famous park.

    With residents scattered, and building debris covered under landscaped lawns, hills, and paths, the community’s memory faded for a century-and-a-half. 
    Yet the village’s destruction via eminent domain left an archival paper trail along with other fragmentary sources. 
    Since the 1990s historians, archeologists, artists, and educators have mined the scattered sources, excavated the site, and sought new ways to recover the village’s history and memory.

<p>
    It remains difficult though to imagine Seneca Village for no photos or drawings survive, and the present-day Central Park site is void of all built environment traces. 
    Envisioning Seneca Village addresses this blindspot in learning about the place and its history. 
    We seek to amplify existing scholarship by offering a visual interpretation of Seneca Village, integrating social historical, archival, and archeological evidence into digital methods of cartographic and architectural reconstruction. 
    We hope our 3D visualization will help visitors access Seneca Village’s history and memory.

    <i>Envisioning Seneca Village</i> is a collaborative project between Gergely Baics, Meredith Linn, Leah Meisterlin, and Myles Zhang that integrates our expertise in 
    archeology, social history, historical GIS, and digital architectural reconstruction. 
    The project has been aided by research assistants, additional support from the Central Park Conservancy, and generous guidance from a diverse group of Seneca Village advisors and stakeholders.
