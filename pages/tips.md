The interactive model can be cumbersome to navigate on a mobile device. If you are having trouble, we suggest using a laptop or desktop computer with a mouse. We have also provided a non-interactive [Tour through Seneca Village](/tour).

**Load the model** by clicking the “play” button in the center of the screen. Once the model has loaded you can access a **full screen** version by clicking the double-sided arrow in the bottom-right or with your “f” key.

## Take the Tour

When the model has loaded, you can **take the tour** by clicking through the model’s annotations.

- The simplest way to do this is by clicking the arrows at the bottom of the screen.
- Alternatively, you can click a specific annotation’s number to access its position and view.  

## Navigating on Your Own

To explore the model, the **default (“orbit”) mode** uses your mouse or trackpad. You can pan, zoom, or orbit around the model. For an overview of the controls, click the **Help (“?”) icon** at the bottom-right of the screen.

If the default settings feel clumsy, you may prefer the **“first person” mode**. Access first person mode by clicking through Settings > Navigation > First Person at the bottom-right of the screen. In this mode, you can…

- use your mouse to rotate your view (like looking around)
- use your arrow keys to move the camera (like walking)

**TIP! Change your walking speed** by scrolling with your mouse or trackpad. We suggest the lowest walking speed (1) to avoid jumping through and around the model.

## More

By default, the model loads in standard definition (SD). You can access a **high definition (HD)** version by clicking through Settings > Textures > HD at the bottom right of the screen.

Virtual reality (VR) options are also available via the VR icon on the bottom-right of the screen.
