| Model-wide | Across the model, many decisions were informed by photos from the surviving Black community of Weeksville, Brooklyn. |
| Building footprints | Drawn from condemnation map. The distances between buildings and the footprint of each are as accurate to the inch as the measurements given on the drawings. High confidence level in accuracy here. This part of the model is as accurate as the primary source. |
