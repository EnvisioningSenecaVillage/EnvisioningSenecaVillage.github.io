title: Speculations & Assumptions

Envisioning and modeling Seneca Village required speculation and making informed assumptions. These assumptions were supported by a variety of factors including New Yorkâ€™s 19th-century architectural history, the variation in declared value of different properties, and input from many of the researchers and scholars who have studied Seneca Village.

This list details those speculations and assumptions. Unless we had evidence for particular buildings or locations, these were applied consistently across the Village allowing for minimal exceptions to produce credible and expected variation.
