title: Speculations & Assumptions
permalink: /speculations/

Envisioning and modeling Seneca Village required speculation and making informed assumptions. These assumptions were supported by a variety of factors including New York’s 19th-century architectural history, the variation in declared value of different properties, and input from many of the researchers and scholars who have studied Seneca Village. These sources can be found in our [References Cited](/references) list and we give our thanks to our many advisors, listed our the [About](/about) page.

This list details those assumptions. Unless we had evidence for particular buildings or locations, these were applied consistently across the Village allowing for minimal exceptions to produce credible and expected variation.

# Model-wide

Many details would have differed day-to-day or season-to-season. We have represented Seneca Village on **a sunny, spring day**, as it might have appeared when the sun came out after a rainstorm to render the streams and foliage more full and visible. The model’s background sky is cropped from Thomas Cole's 1836 oil painting [The Oxbow](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10497).

Many decisions across the model were informed by photos from the surviving Black community of Weeksville, Brooklyn.

The number of details and refinements we could attempt to imagine are endless. We limited the visualization to the resolution one might see at a distance, to maintain reasonable loading times within a browser and to prevent unnecessary speculation. For instance, the model does not show doorknobs, house gutters, species of individual plants, or three-dimensional crops.

# Buildings

**Building sizes** are determined by their footprints and height, in number of floors, indicated on the Sage condemnation map. The distances between buildings and the footprint of each building are as accurate (to the inch) as the measurements given on the original drawings. Floor-to-floor heights in frame houses are modeled at ten feet for the ground floor and up to nine feet for higher levels. Shanties’ interiors are modeled with minimum heights of eight feet (at their shortest, beneath a sloped roof).

**Rooflines**: Double-sided pitched roofs are assumed for houses and higher-value shanties. Single-sided pitched roofs are assumed for lower-valued shanties, barns, stables, and outhouses. For rectangular houses, we have assumed that roof ridges are parallel to the shortest side of the house. However, most houses have square footprints, and thus we cannot infer the direction of a roof ridge from the footprint alone. Where this is the case, the roof ridge line is parallel to the street. (This assumption stems from the practical constructions of side-by-side buildings given the proximity of some neighboring houses in the model as well as the imagined potential for new building construction as the Village was growing.)

**Building materials**: Most non-shanty buildings assume foundations made of Manhattan schist. The model assumes foundations are dug a few feet deep and rise between 6 and 12 inches above ground level, upon which a wood frame is built. 

Wood-frame shanties are modeled with floorboards lifted between 6 and 12 inches from the ground, supported at their corners and (depending on their overall size) middle. Self-built vernacular architecture in 19th-century New York also existed on a spectrum–often starting as a single-room wood-frame shanty that would, over time, be built out into a larger, more permanent structure. Given this gradual process of upgrading and reflecting the tendency toward under-valuing properties through eminent domain, about half the homes labeled “shanty” in the condemnation maps are modeled with schist foundations.

**Wood siding** assumed for building exteriors, with boards of 6 and 9 inches wide. 

**Chimneys** are modeled based on building type. For houses, a brick chimney (1-2 square feet in plan, broader at its base than top, and extending 2-4 feet above the roofline) is assumed. Brick can be stacked in the small-footprint columns needed to construct a chimney, whereas schist cannot. For shanties, we have assumed a smaller, metal flue cut through the roof and extending above the roofline, based on historical drawings and photos.

**Roofing materials**: Imbricated tin slats are assumed for the roof of most houses. Slate and wood clapboard are modeled for the houses with the highest value.

**Doors**: Where primary entrances are unclear from the sources, doors were placed facing roads.

**Windows**: Larger windows are assumed for homes than for stables and barns. All homes have double-hung windows, with each window composed of smaller panes (between 6 and 9 inches square). Preference was given to the southern exposure, for reasons of sunlight and warmth.

**Shutters**: We assumed that all homes had shutters. That said, most shutters could be detached and stored during the months when they were not needed. Given our model during the spring, roughly half of the windows are shown with shutters, and the other half without. More expensive houses are shown with painted shutters, made from wood boards fitted together with dovetail joints. Lower valued houses are shown with unpainted shutters (or peeling paint) fitted together with nails and a wooden crossbeam.

# Landscape

**Trees** (locations and sizes) are based on the Viele map which includes small sketches. Based on the representations within this map, trees were categorized into four types:

1. The most common is a short, bushy tree shaped as a fruit tree or other small tree;
2. A large, bushy tree, shaped as a full-grown oak;
3. A large, round tree, shaped as a giant willow, found only along Seventh Avenue; and
4. The least common is a tall, skinny tree shaped as a cypress or pine.
   We have not assumed species, but have assumed shapes and replicated each instance of the four types included in the Viele map, totalling about 150 trees across the village.

**The Croton Reservoir** looms large in the Village landscape, but its exact height above Seneca Village is unclear from primary sources. However, the Distributing Reservoir at 42nd Street was 70 feet above sea level, or 120 feet to maximum water level assuming 50-foot retaining walls from archival photos. Therefore, the retaining wall for the Receiving Reservoir at Seneca Village is shown with retaining walls high enough to produce an elevation 130 feet above sea level.

**Water supply**: Residences lacked access to the Croton Reservoir by internal plumbing. Primary sources indicate a well adjacent to the Mathews House and a place for animals to drink at Tanner's Spring. We show dirt paths to and from Tanner's Spring as well as a staircase for residents and the Geary family to access the Croton Reservoir.

**Streams**: The primary sources indicate a stream parallel to what is now Seventh Avenue as well as one running away from Tanner’s Spring. We assume these were seasonal streams and gullies depressed one to two feet below ground and surrounded by vegetation due to better growing conditions near water.

# Human Elements

Based on recommendations from our advisory group, the model does not depict people. That said, Seneca Village was not empty, and the model instead shows evidence of human activity. We  aim to indicate how everyday life would have influenced the appearance of the Village. Children’s toys and the tools for various professions are included. Spaces of congregation, such as churches and schools, or other areas with greater foot traffic are reflected on the ground. Wells indicate the common and necessary activity of gathering water at its sources. And animals, along with the fencing they require, speak to both sustenance activities and work., such as dirt paths, laundry lines, as well as signs of building wear and tear from continuous use.

**Desire lines**: We assume villagers would have taken the shortest (or easiest) route possible between places within the Village. Desire lines (paths worn by repeated use) are modeled, extending 15-20 feet in front of most doorways. Dirt-swept areas in places with significant foot traffic are represented, such as the area next to Ishmael Allen’s shop for outdoor work, in front of the Wilson House, and behind the public school house where children might have played games like hopscotch.

**Cemeteries** are rendered with a mixture of grave markers.

**Cultivated fields**: To the extent feasible, these areas reflect known agricultural activity in the Village. Crop rows are planted perpendicular to the sun’s orientation to maximize light. In areas of the Village with steeper topography, crop rows are rendered perpendicular to the slope.

**Fences** are applied across the Village only to keep animals penned or protect crops from animals. Other uses (such as separating properties) are not assumed for fences. Cultivated lands are fenced, as are areas that include chicken coops. Fences surround properties that include stables or animal barns. These vary in height by the type of animals included. Fences show openings for gates in the part of each cultivated field adjacent to the nearest house.

**Animals and carts**: The archaeological record hints at the kinds and numbers of animals that residents would have owned. For selected locations, we show pigs and chickens roaming around, as well as cows and horses confined to wooden pens. For Andrew Williams and villagers known to work with horses, we show carts in the nearest yards.
